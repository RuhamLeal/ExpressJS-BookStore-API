# BookStore-API

An API that sends book and author data, works with GET, PUT, DELETE and POST requests.

## Getting Started

To access the api you need to go to your preferred browser and request the api url. The api was uploaded with a public IP through the AWS cloud system. To see the code of the project you can install it locally ( Below you will find the instructions ).

Note: Because the API is public I removed the PUT and POST methods to avoid compromising the API, but here in the repository it's complete :)

API url: http://15.228.199.125:3000
authors endpoint: http://15.228.199.125:3000/autores
books endpoint: http://15.228.199.125:3000/livros
